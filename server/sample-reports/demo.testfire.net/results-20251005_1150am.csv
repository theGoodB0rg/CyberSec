https://demo.testfire.net/bank/login.aspx,POST,uid,Boolean-based blind SQL injection,Account enumeration responded differently to OR-based predicates. Confidence derived from 3/3 positive payloads.
https://demo.testfire.net/bank/search.aspx,GET,query,Union query SQL injection,UNION payload exposed account table with matching column count. Retest with tamper scripts confirmed consistent delays.
https://demo.testfire.net/bank/account.aspx,GET,id,Error-based SQL injection,Server echoed JDBC error revealing Oracle version metadata. Manual verification reproduced the SQL error messages.
https://demo.testfire.net/bank/transfer.aspx,POST,amount,Time-based blind SQL injection,Inference payload with dbms_pipe.receive_message delayed response by 6 seconds. Heuristic fingerprint matched historical injection behaviour.
